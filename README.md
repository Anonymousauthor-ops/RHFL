# JSHFL: Defending against Poisoning Attacks in Hierarchical Federated Learning Utilizing Jensen-Shannon Divergence

## Overview
This repository contains the official implementation of JSHFL as described in the paper "Defending against Poisoning Attacks in Hierarchical Federated Learning Utilizing Jensen-Shannon Divergence". Our method leverages the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to enhance the robustness of hierarchical federated learning systems against various untargeted malcious poisoning attacks.

## Datasets

This implementation has been tested on the following datasets:
- MNIST
- Fashion-MNIST
- CIFAR-10

## Model Architectures

We have integrated JSHFL with the following model architectures:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- ResNet-20

## Installation
- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch 1.7+
